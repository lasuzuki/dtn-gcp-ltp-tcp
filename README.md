# Three-Node Network communication via DTN on Google Cloud Platform and Windows Azure :rocket:

This is the third 5th tutorial on a series of DTN on Google Cloud tutorials. In the [first tutorial](https://github.com/lasuzuki/dtn-gcp), we introduced the ION software and its main functionalities, in addition to an intro to Google Cloud VMs.

In this tutorial we will introduce you to Windows Azure, and how to configure a 3-node network using ION. The figure below shows the network we will be building. Note that this example network uses two different convergence layers: TCP and LTP. This can illustrates the case of a terrestrial connection with two interplanetary internet nodes.
